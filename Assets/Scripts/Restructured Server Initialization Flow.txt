Steps to Solve the Issue:
Restructured Server Initialization Flow:

Moved the CreateServer call to before the scene load in ApplicationController.cs, ensuring that the ServerGameManager and all server-related components are initialized before any networked objects are spawned in the scene.
Ensured GameManager is Not Null Before Proceeding:

Added explicit checks to confirm that GameManager is properly initialized after calling CreateServer.
If GameManager is null after initialization, we log an error and stop further execution, preventing potential runtime failures.
Enhanced Error Logging for Server Creation:

In CreateServer, added more detailed error handling to catch any issues that may prevent the ServerGameManager from being initialized. This ensures that failures during server setup are clearly visible in the logs.
Adjusted the Flow of Scene Loading:

Modified the flow to:
Instantiate the ServerSingleton.
Initialize the server by calling CreateServer.
Ensure that GameManager is properly initialized.
Only then, load the game scene and start the server.
Added Detailed Execution Flow for "Find Match" Button:

Documented the full execution order from the "Find Match" button press, through server instantiation, scene loading, and network server startup.
Outcome:
With these changes, we ensure that ServerSingleton.Instance.GameManager is properly initialized before any network operations, preventing null reference errors during player spawning.
