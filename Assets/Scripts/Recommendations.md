DONE: Use Asynchronous Scene Loading: Replace SceneManager.LoadScene with SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync to make the transition smoother.



GameManager is Null:

From the logs: "GameManager is null after CreateServer, aborting server startup." and later "¦| ServerGameManager created successfully."
This suggests the GameManager was null at some point during initialization, causing an error early on, but it still proceeded further. It seems contradictory because it says the GameManager was successfully created afterward, which indicates a logical gap or some asynchronous delay. We need to make sure this value is properly assigned before any dependent processes are invoked.
Misleading Log Flow:

The sequence of logs indicates that there might be misleading or redundant debug statements in the server initialization flow. Adding a check just before logging "GameManager is null after CreateServer..." could help verify if it's truly null or if it's a timing issue due to how async operations are scheduled. Adding debug logs both before and after assignment could help here.
Initialization Order and Debugging Suggestions:

Add some distinctive debug logs at the critical points of your server setup, like before and after creating the ServerGameManager, before and after setting up callbacks, and just before starting the server (e.g., "Attempting to start server...").
Ensure you're waiting for the entire server initialization (CreateServer) process to complete before trying to run subsequent logic. Sometimes tasks that should run synchronously might not do so because of async behavior.
Handle Player Events Properly in Dedicated Server:

In the TankPlayer class, make sure that OnPlayerSpawned is triggered correctly in a dedicated server environment. This method is crucial for properly registering players in the leaderboard. It's possible that the callback is not being triggered in dedicated mode due to an initialization issue.
For the leaderboard, confirm that the event handlers (OnPlayerSpawned, OnPlayerDespawned) are subscribed only once and not missed due to timing discrepancies. Print debug statements to verify their registration.
LeaderBoard Issue on Dedicated Server:

It's possible that on the dedicated server, the leaderboard entries are not being updated because the OnPlayerSpawned and HandleLeaderboardEntitiesChanged aren't being triggered at all. Given the host build works, focus on debugging why the dedicated server is not properly invoking the same.
Make sure the NetworkList<LeaderboardEntityState> is populated correctly for dedicated server builds. The discrepancy could be in how the client and server synchronize these states.
Check Server Log Consistency:

Make sure to include script-specific debug identifiers in each log, as suggested. For example, <ServerGameManager> or <TankPlayer> would make tracking the flow in server logs significantly easier. Logs like "GameManager created successfully" should mention the script from where it is being logged to avoid confusion.












Validating Player Names on Dedicated Server:
		Ensure the player name set in PlayerPrefs is validated on the server during the connection approval phase (e.g., avoid inappropriate names or duplicates).  

Centralize Player Data Management: Consider using a PlayerDataManager to handle player name preferences instead of managing it directly in the NameSelector script.
Add Logging: Add more Debug.Log statements to confirm key operations, especially during scene transitions and player data handling. This will aid in debugging.
Maintain Player Name Validation: Ensure player names are validated both client-side and server-side to maintain consistency and prevent undesired states.


Best Practice for Network Code
Since you are using Netcode for GameObjects (NGO), ensure that you:
Avoid Re-registering Callbacks: If callbacks are added during the server creation process, make sure they're only added once. This prevents callbacks from being registered multiple times, which can lead to unexpected behaviors.
Confirm Server State Before Starting: Before starting network operations, confirm that Unity Services and the NetworkManager are fully initialized and that the GameManager is not null. This avoids partially set-up states that could cause the player sync issues you�re troubleshooting.

1. Networking Sync Issues
Ensure that the player names and coin counts are synchronized properly over the network. For example, if you are using Unity�s Netcode for GameObjects or another networking solution, you must ensure:

Variables such as player names and coin amounts are marked as [SyncVar]


Key Areas to Investigate:
Network Synchronization:

The LeaderboardEntityDisplay relies on NetworkVariable or NetworkList updates to trigger changes. Ensure that the PlayerName and Coins are correctly synchronized between the server and the clients.
NetworkList Synchronization:
You mentioned that you are using a NetworkList<LeaderboardEntityState>. Ensure that the server is correctly adding entries to this list and that the clients are properly receiving updates from the server.

1. Player Prefab Synchronization:
Since the name is sometimes not displaying, it might be an issue with synchronizing the player name across clients. This could be related to the timing of how and when the player prefab is instantiated and when the player name data is synced across the network.

Where to Focus:

PlayerName as a NetworkVariable: In the TankPlayer class (or similar), the player name is likely a NetworkVariable<FixedString32Bytes>. Ensure this variable is being correctly synchronized between the server and clients after the player is spawned.
