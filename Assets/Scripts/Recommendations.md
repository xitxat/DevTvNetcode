DONE: Use Asynchronous Scene Loading: Replace SceneManager.LoadScene with SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync to make the transition smoother.
Validating Player Names on Dedicated Server:
		Ensure the player name set in PlayerPrefs is validated on the server during the connection approval phase (e.g., avoid inappropriate names or duplicates).  

Centralize Player Data Management: Consider using a PlayerDataManager to handle player name preferences instead of managing it directly in the NameSelector script.
Add Logging: Add more Debug.Log statements to confirm key operations, especially during scene transitions and player data handling. This will aid in debugging.
Maintain Player Name Validation: Ensure player names are validated both client-side and server-side to maintain consistency and prevent undesired states.


Best Practice for Network Code
Since you are using Netcode for GameObjects (NGO), ensure that you:
Avoid Re-registering Callbacks: If callbacks are added during the server creation process, make sure they're only added once. This prevents callbacks from being registered multiple times, which can lead to unexpected behaviors.
Confirm Server State Before Starting: Before starting network operations, confirm that Unity Services and the NetworkManager are fully initialized and that the GameManager is not null. This avoids partially set-up states that could cause the player sync issues you’re troubleshooting.

1. Networking Sync Issues
Ensure that the player names and coin counts are synchronized properly over the network. For example, if you are using Unity’s Netcode for GameObjects or another networking solution, you must ensure:

Variables such as player names and coin amounts are marked as [SyncVar]


Key Areas to Investigate:
Network Synchronization:

The LeaderboardEntityDisplay relies on NetworkVariable or NetworkList updates to trigger changes. Ensure that the PlayerName and Coins are correctly synchronized between the server and the clients.
NetworkList Synchronization:
You mentioned that you are using a NetworkList<LeaderboardEntityState>. Ensure that the server is correctly adding entries to this list and that the clients are properly receiving updates from the server.

1. Player Prefab Synchronization:
Since the name is sometimes not displaying, it might be an issue with synchronizing the player name across clients. This could be related to the timing of how and when the player prefab is instantiated and when the player name data is synced across the network.

Where to Focus:

PlayerName as a NetworkVariable: In the TankPlayer class (or similar), the player name is likely a NetworkVariable<FixedString32Bytes>. Ensure this variable is being correctly synchronized between the server and clients after the player is spawned.
